            The word "science" probably brings to mind many different pictures: a fat textbook, white lab coats
             and microscopes, an astronomer 
             peering through a telescope, a naturalist in the 
           rainforest, Einstein's equations scribbled on a chalkboard, the launch of the space shuttle, 
             bubbling beakers.... All of those images reflect some aspect of science. But none of them provides a full picture because science has so 
            many facets: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science" target="_blank">More</a>
