			<h3>Clothing and Shelter</h3>
			<p>One of the fundamental ways technology has impacted human history is through its influence on clothing and shelter. Early humans used natural materials such as animal skins, leaves, and branches to protect themselves from the elements. However, as technology advanced, so did our ability to create more sophisticated clothing and shelter. From the invention of sewing needles to the development of advanced construction techniques, technology has enabled us to create comfortable and durable clothing and build safe and efficient structures.</p>
